# couponclues
This is an app we created in a Hackathon event the main aim was to churn up a predictive algorithm that will help in predictive selling .It tries to emulate a alogrithm for predictive user - user product affinity by using jaccard index to rank the products .

Also a mock UI is made to depict a prediction based coupon app .
